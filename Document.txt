A python class is a group of attribute and methods.
Attribute is variable.
Method is function inside class
Constructor is: def __init__(self, pass parrameter)
__init__() method is used o initliaze variables.This is soecial method, we don't need to call this method explicitly. as object created, it called
use self variable whwever using attriibute inside class.
Object is class type variable or class insatnce.To us eclass, creqate object of class
INstance creation allot memory neccasry to store actual data of varaible.
Each time when an object created of a class, variable's copy is created which is define in cass earlier.
object_name=class_name(arg)//arg is actual argument.actual argu,emt are passed while calling , formal passed while creating
Example,
class MObile:
def __init__(self):
self.model="Samasung"
def show_model(self):
print("MOdel:",self.model)
samsung=Mobile()
AS object created a block of memory is allocated on heap, and size of memeory will be 
equal to the available varibale and methods inside class.
After allocating memory, speciAL METHOD __init() called internally.it stores data to variable.
object will have memory location and it gets passed to self because self variable point toward current object.
use object to access class variabe and method.
like: object.varname
object.classmethod()
#text filethis is
Self is default variable and it will have memeory adress of current object.
This variable is used to reefr all instance variable and method.
self is first argument to object method because first argument is always object reference.
